🚀 Drug Data Analysis – Internship Project at Unifies Mentor
📌 Project Type: Data Analysis
📌 Tools & Technologies: Python, Jupyter Notebook, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
📌 Dataset: Pharmaceutical data containing drug names, medical conditions, side effects, ratings, interactions, and classifications.

📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing drug-related data to uncover key insights such as:
Most commonly prescribed drugs.
Drug classes categorized as Rx (prescription) vs. OTC (over-the-counter).
Common side effects and their frequency.
Pregnancy safety categories and alcohol interactions.
CSA (Controlled Substances Act) classification of drugs.
Relationship between drug ratings and number of reviews.
The project was implemented using Python in Jupyter Notebook, utilizing data cleaning, transformation, and visualization techniques to extract meaningful insights.

🛠 How I Solved Data Challenges
🔹 Data Import & Exploration: Loaded the dataset and checked for missing values.
🔹 Data Cleaning & Handling Missing Data: Used mode imputation, mean/median replacement, and forward/backward fill for missing values.
🔹 Data Transformation: Filtered, grouped, and summarized key insights using Pandas.
🔹 Data Visualization: Generated insightful visualizations to interpret drug usage trends.

📊 Charts & Graphs Used for Data Visualization
To effectively present the findings, I used different visualization techniques:
✅ Bar Charts – Top medical conditions & side effects.
✅ Pie Charts – Proportion of pregnancy safety categories & alcohol interactions.
✅ Scatter Plot – Relationship between drug ratings and number of reviews.
✅ Step Graph – Ranking of top-rated drugs.
✅ Steam Graph – CSA classification distribution.

These helped visualize key trends, risks, and drug classifications in a clear and insightful manner.

💡 Key Learnings & Outcomes
📌 Strengthened Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn skills.
📌 Gained insights into data-driven decision-making in pharmaceuticals.
📌 Improved data cleaning, visualization, and storytelling abilities.
